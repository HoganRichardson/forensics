title: "Reflection on the Course"
---
The last four weeks of semester have been extremely busy, and I haven't had a chance to do regular reflections. Additionally, I was focusing on my extended research project, so I didn't do as much work on the normal coursework during that time. 

The course is drawing to a close, and I am working on finishing off assessment 2. It has been an interesting challenge, and challenge is definitely a word to use. It is more of a CTF-focused adventure, which means there is a little less guidance on how to approach it, and there could be extremely tricky or awkward places that I may have to manoeuver to find all flags. So far, I have found 6, so I am on track with the task, and the image from `mspaint` has revealed some interesting information.

*Closing Remarks*

I have really enjoyed the forensics course this semester. Whilst there were some issues and hiccups, it has been a great journey, and I have learned a lot and improved my skills in solving challenges and investigating security. I have really enjoyed the opportunity to learn and reflect on Digital Forensics. 

My main adventure outside of the coursework was the extended research project, which gave me a chance to work on something different and relevant. When I approached the research, I focused on an scientific mindset, ensuring that everything I did was clearly documented and recorded so that it could be reproduced and extended further. I hope that my research proves useful to others when investigating Dropbox cloud sync, and I'm sure I'll check back on it one day in the future for reference.

Thats a wrap!
