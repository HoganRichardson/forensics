This page contains a list of tools I have used/been exposed to throughout forensics, with a short description of the usefullness of each.

# Command-line Utilities
## Vanilla Tools
* `dd` performs a 1:1/byte-for-byte copy of a file/folder

## Disk Structures/Partition Tables
* `lsblk -a`
* `df -a`

## macOS-specific
* `ls -l@` will display all 'forks' or Alternate Data Stream files in the directory
* `hdiutil` & `diskutil`

Note: I will endeavour to add links to html man pages for the above tools where available.
